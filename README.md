# id-kss-builder
A KSS theme for creating styleguides in Boston University
repositories.

This theme uses Grunt and node-sass to compile Sass to CSS.

## Get started

Run `npm install` to install dependencies, then run `grunt` to
begin watching your Sass files. This builder places Sass files
in the `css-dev` folder.

You can also run `grunt build` to manually build the Sass anytime.
